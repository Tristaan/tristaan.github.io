Hello,
my name is Tristan Å neider and I come from Slovenia. My primary occupation is system administration, but I am also quite active in the fields of programming and managing computers for people around my place. Currenlty I study for my electrical engineering degree, which is taking forever because there's always something else to do.

If you are working on projects that are somewhat similar to mine, or you deem them similar to mine and you need help with them. Don't be afraid to drop me a [mail](mailto:tristan@sneider.si). I offer my services to anyone if I can find the time. You can also find me on [Freelancer](https://www.freelancer.com/u/Tristan95)!

Well, now that you know my mail, drop one whenever you want and help me fill this website with more content for people to read!

### Look at some of my online footprints below:

* [Github](https://github.com/tristaan)
* [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/Tristan_)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tristan-%C5%A1neider-66b859158/)

Enjoy and have a great time whenever,
