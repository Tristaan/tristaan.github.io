There is one wine barrel that lies around in my backyard and I didn't want to throw it away so I thought of something to do with it. I checked the interwebs for some guidance where I found some Youtube videos which seemed quite helpful and some textual guides, which were only practical when there were pictures included.

## The initial idea
All these people that made these smokers, didn't really make any plans for the smokers, they just went with it. So I thought to myself, why not create one with included drawings, which makes it easier for others to improve based on my designs.

First I made some simple drawings by hand, which you can see here:

As you can see there is an opening at the top for the meat to be put inside. Then at the bottom of the barrel I added a door which is used to fill in wood. This door must be air tight so air regulation can be handled by the input pipe that is at the side of the barrel. The other end of it is under the fire so that at the top there is a proper smoke mixture.
