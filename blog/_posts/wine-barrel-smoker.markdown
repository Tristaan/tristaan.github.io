There is one wine barrel that lies around in my backyard and I didn't want to throw it away so I thought of something to do with it. I checked the interwebs for some guidance where I found some Youtube videos which seemed quite helpful and some textual guides, which were only practical when there were pictures included.

## The initial idea
All these people that made these smokers, didn't really upload any plans for the smokers, they just made it from their mind. So I thought to myself, why not create one with included drawings, which makes it easier for others to improve based on my designs and ultimately lead to the best possible wine barrel smoker.

Here is the BOM and simple drawing of the barrel with steps written down:

## The annoying part
The planks and barrel hoops need to be screwed together, because splitting the barrel into two pieces can make it fall apart. Video No. 4 shows that tightening the hoops by hitting them towards the belly of the barrel is also an option, but I did not choose this way because it doesn't look everlasting. I went with screws.
This takes some time, some of the other people said it takes from 1-2 hours, but it took me **blabla** hours.

## The split
After the screwing was done, I used my Bosch circular saw which has one of those hinge thingies included. I used this hinge to measure of about *15* centimeters from the top and then just cut straight around the barrel, after tightening the thingy to the saw. This was quite a straight forward task because of the proper tools available.
